# Notes Taker ![License: MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)


## Description

The project is a note taker, you are able to create, delete and view all your notes. This project was built to further my knowledge of the express framework and working with servers. All front end code was provided, I only worked on the backend.

## Installation

To run it locally, you will need to run the following to install the needed package dependencies:
  
    npm i

## Usage

When running locally, start the program with:

    node server.js

Press 'Get Started' to navigate to the notes taking page. From there you can click existing notes on the left to view them, press the garbage icon to delete existing notes (this cannot be undone). You can press the plus sign in the top right to create a new note. The Note Taker title in the top left will navigate you back to the landing page.

You can end the server by pressing:

    ctrl+c
